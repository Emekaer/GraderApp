# GraderApp

A simple application built with React Native for calculating GPAs on a 4 point scale. You are also allowed to delete wrong information. It has has error handling and input of countless number of courses. Due to time constraints the following are missing

- User Sign In & Authentication
- Persistent Data
- A splash screen

This application can run both on Android and on IOS.

Feel free to check out the remainder of my projects.
